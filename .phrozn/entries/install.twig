<h2>Installing KalSMS</h2>

Before installing KalSMS, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

<ul>
    <li>One or more Android phones (1.6 Donut or higher) that are
    registered on a mobile network. </li>
    <li>A way for the phones to connect to the internet, either via Wi-Fi
    or the mobile data service. <br  />
    (Even if using Wi-Fi, mobile data 
    service is necessary to receive MMS messages.)    </li>
    <li> A web server accessible from the public internet </li>
</ul>

To install the current release version of KalSMS on an Android phone, 
either scan the barcode below with a QR code app, 
or click the link from your phone's browser. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>or</em> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<span style='font-size:20px;font-weight:bold'>

</span>

<p>
Alternatively, software developers may <a href="https://github.com/youngj/KalSMS">download the source code from GitHub</a>
and build KalSMS themselves.
</p>

<h2>Configuring KalSMS</h2>

<h3>Server Configuration</h3>

<p>
It is assumed that your organization already has an HTTP server, or has the technical expertise to set up an HTTP server.
</p>

<p>
Follow the instructions in the <a href='serverapi.html'>API Reference</a> page to learn how to construct a 
resource on your HTTP server that can communicate with KalSMS.
</p>

<h3>Phone Configuration</h3>

<div style='float:right;padding-left:10px;padding-bottom:10px'>    
<img src='media/screenshot-settings.png' width='211' height='347' />
</div>


<p>
After your server is configured, configure KalSMS on your phone to connect to your server as follows:
</p>

<ol>

<li>Open the KalSMS app</li>
<li>Click the Menu button, then "Settings"</li>
<li>Configure KalSMS to work with your server by entering:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>your server URL</li>
            <li>your phone number</li>
            <li>the password shared with the server</li>
        </ul>
<li>Choose an interval to poll for new outgoing messages</li>
<li><em>Recommended:</em> under Wi-Fi sleep policy, select "always stay connected".
    (Otherwise, KalSMS will be unable to forward messages after the phone goes to sleep.)
</li>
<li>Check "Enable KalSMS"</li>
<li>Click the Back button to return to the main screen</li>
</ol>

<p>
To test if KalSMS has been configured properly and can connect
to your server, open the KalSMS app, click the Menu button, 
then click "Test Connection".
</p>

<p>
<strong>Important:</strong> After KalSMS is enabled, it will forward all SMS messages regardless of whether the
KalSMS app is open. If you want to use SMS normally again, return to KalSMS' settings screen
and uncheck "Enable KalSMS". 
</p>

<h3>Installing Expansion Packs</h3>

<p>
    By default, Android prevents KalSMS from sending more than 100 outgoing SMS messages per hour. 
    However, that limit can be increased by installing KalSMS Expansion Packs.
</p>
<p>
    Each Expansion Pack allows KalSMS to increase its sending limit by an additional 100 outgoing SMS messages
    per hour. For example, if you install 14 expansion packs, KalSMS will be able to send up to 1500 outgoing SMS messages
    per hour.

    <a href='http://envaya.org/_media/kalsms-pack02.apk'>KalSMS Expansion Pack 02</a>    
</p>
<p>
    With Expansion Packs, KalSMS is limited only by how fast your phone can send and receive SMS, 
    and by your mobile provider's usage limits and terms of service.
