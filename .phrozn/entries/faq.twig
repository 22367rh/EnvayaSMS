</p>
<p>
EnvayaSMS has been tested and is known to work with the following phones:

<ul>

</ul>

<h4>Does EnvayaSMS use envaya.org's servers?</h4>

<p>
No. When using EnvayaSMS, you connect it to your own web server. 
The EnvayaSMS Android app does not connect to <a href='http://envaya.org'>envaya.org</a> or any third-party servers. 
In particular, you do not need to register for <a href='http://envaya.org'>envaya.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
For information about configuring a web server to connect to EnvayaSMS, see the <a href='serverapi.html'>API Reference</a> page.
</p>

<h4>What is the relationship between EnvayaSMS and envaya.org?</h4>

<p>
We originally developed EnvayaSMS to enable civil society organizations in East Africa to interact with
<a href='http://envaya.org'>envaya.org</a> via SMS and MMS, such as by posting news updates and photos
to their website. 
</p>
<p>
We realized that EnvayaSMS would be useful for any web service that needs to send and receive SMS/MMS, 
and decided to make EnvayaSMS available for anyone building their own applications.
</p>
<p>
Development of EnvayaSMS is currently led by the <a href='http://envaya.org'>envaya.org</a> team,
but anyone is welcome to contribute to improve it.

<h4>What is the relationship between EnvayaSMS and KalSMS?</h4>

<p>
The source code for EnvayaSMS was originally based on <a href='https://github.com/niryariv/kalsms/'>KalSMS</a>, an open-source project 
started by Nir Yariv in 2010 that introduced the idea of a simple SMS gateway implemented entirely as an Android app. 
EnvayaSMS is a complete rewrite that shares little code with KalSMS.
</p>

<p>
EnvayaSMS builds upon the idea of KalSMS by adding many new features that would be necessary for anyone deploying an SMS gateway in the field,
such as sending more than 100 messages per hour, authenticating the phone to the server, and retrying forwarding messages after transient errors.
For a complete list of changes, see the <a href='history.html'>History</a> page. 
</p>
<p>
EnvayaSMS's server API is incompatible with that of KalSMS. Anyone switching from KalSMS to EnvayaSMS must 
update their server to use the new API described on the <a href='serverapi.html'>API Reference</a> page.
</p>
<p>
 As of 2011, KalSMS is no longer actively developed, and new development will occur on the EnvayaSMS project.
