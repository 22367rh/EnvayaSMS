EnvayaSMS is a SMS and MMS gateway running entirely as an Android app.

<p>
It forwards incoming SMS and MMS messages to a web server on the Internet, and sends
outgoing messages from the web server to other phones.
</p>

<p>
People with any type of mobile phone can send SMS and MMS to a phone
running EnvayaSMS, without needing their own Android phone.
</p>

<p>
It works wherever the phone can receive SMS messages and access the Internet 
(via Wi-Fi or mobile data connection).
</p>

<h2>Why EnvayaSMS?</h2>   
    
<p>
    EnvayaSMS can be used to enable any web service to send and receive SMS and MMS messages
    nearly anywhere in the world.
</p>
<p> In particular, it is useful in countries where obtaining a local virtual phone number 
    or SMS shortcode is difficult, expensive, or impossible. A phone running EnvayaSMS 
    connects to the phone network in the same way as any other mobile phone, 
    so it can be set up without needing approval from anyone else.
</p>

<p>
    EnvayaSMS is designed to to be maintainable even when deployed in remote locations 
    that cannot easily be accessed by your organization's technical staff. 
    With minimal training, non-technical users can do all setup and maintenance of deployed phones.
</p>


<h2>Price</h2>
<p>
    EnvayaSMS is free to install on as many phones as you'd like.
</p>
<p>
    In order to deploy EnvayaSMS, you will need an Android phone with service on a mobile network.
