KalSMS is a SMS/MMS gateway running entirely as an Android app.

<p>
It forwards incoming SMS and MMS messages to a web server on the Internet, and sends
outgoing messages from the web server to other phones.
</p>

<p>
People with any type of mobile phone can send SMS and MMS to a phone
running KalSMS, without needing their own Android phone.
</p>

<p>
It works wherever the phone can receive SMS messages and access the Internet 
(via Wi-Fi or mobile data connection).
</p>

<h2>Why KalSMS?</h2>   
    
<p>
    KalSMS can be used to enable a web service to send and receive SMS and MMS messages
    nearly anywhere in the world.
</p>
<p> In particular, it is useful in countries where obtaining a local virtual phone number 
    or SMS shortcode is difficult, expensive, or impossible. A phone running KalSMS 
    connects to the phone network in the same way as any other mobile phone, 
    so it can be set up without needing approval from anyone else.
</p>

<p>
    KalSMS is designed to to be maintainable even when deployed in remote locations 
    that cannot easily be accessed by your organization's technical staff. KalSMS is simple
    enough for non-technical users to do all setup and maintenance of deployed phones.
</p>


<h2>Price</h2>
<p>
    KalSMS is free to install on as many phones as you'd like.
</p>
<p>
    In order to deploy KalSMS, you will need a messaging plan for your phone, and the phone itself. 
    KalSMS is compatible with many old or inexpensive Android phones, e.g. the LG GT540, currently $120 on Amazon.com.
</p>   
<p>
    Typically your organization will need only one phone running KalSMS in a 
    particular country. However, it is possible to use multiple phones to load-balance requests 
    for higher throughput, to offer different user services, or to serve different mobile networks.
